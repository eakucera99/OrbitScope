# OrbitScope: A Project Management Case Study 

## Project Overview

OrbitScope is a real-time satellite tracking and visualization tool that provides an interactive 3D experience using CesiumJS, React, Python, and Flask. The project integrates real-time satellite telemetry data, allowing users to explore orbits dynamically.

## Goal & Problem Statement

The goal was to build a scalable, interactive satellite tracking dashboard within a week to demonstrate technical and project management expertise. The key challenge was integrating CesiumJS for real-time visualization while ensuring smooth data retrieval and UI performance.

## Planning & Execution

***Agile Methodology:*** Used iterative development cycles with daily progress tracking.

***Tech Stack Selection:*** Chose React for front-end flexibility, Flask for backend APIs, and CesiumJS for real-time 3D visualization.

***Roadmap & Milestones:*** Defined core features (satellite tracking, orbit visualization, API integration) and set a strict timeline.

***Risk Management:*** Identified potential bottlenecks (API delays, performance issues) and planned for alternative solutions.

## Challenges & Solutions

Data Latency from APIs → Implemented caching to reduce redundant API calls.

CesiumJS Performance Optimization → Used Level of Detail (LOD) rendering and lazy loading for smooth interaction.

Tight Deadline → Prioritized MVP features first, then iterated based on feedback.

## Outcome & Impact

- Successfully developed a working prototype within a week.
- Demonstrated expertise in project scoping, execution, and risk mitigation.
- Strengthened hands-on experience with Agile, full-stack development, and geospatial visualization.
- Positioned as a portfolio highlight to showcase both technical and project management skills.
